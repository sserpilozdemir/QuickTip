# QuickTip
 
H E L L O V I S I T E R !

This mini-project is written with pure JS by Chris Dixon.
Quick Tip calculates the tip amount to be given according to the incoming order amount.

I have learned lots of things about JS and CSS.
 Especially CSS part is so clear. 
 JS part also consists of lots of "Events".  It has really improved my DOM skill.
